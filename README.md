# **rosamllib**

**rosamllib** is a Python package for reading, manipulating, and visualizing DICOM files, particularly focusing on radiotherapy-related DICOM formats like RTSTRUCT and RTDOSE. The library simplifies the process of extracting useful information from DICOM files, overlaying contours on medical images, and resampling dose grids for dose distribution visualization.

## **Features**

- **DICOM Image Handling**: Supports reading, resampling, and visualization of DICOM images.
- **RTSTRUCT Handling**: Extracts contours, generates masks for structures, and overlays them on medical images.
- **RTDOSE Handling**: Resamples dose grids to match CT image grids and visualizes dose distribution.
- **Simple and Intuitive API**: Easy-to-use API for manipulating DICOM datasets, working with medical images, and visualizing structures and dose distributions.
